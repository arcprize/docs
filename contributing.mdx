### AI-Generated Code

AI is an incredible tool with the power to automate valuable work. However, it can also produce verbose code and introduce hidden or unnecessary complexity. We hold strict guidelines to keep our repositories clean and maintainable.

PRs with simple, easy-to-understand code will be prioritized. If your contribution uses AI-assisted tooling, please review the output carefully and remove any unnecessary abstractions or boilerplate before submitting.
