All games implement a standardized action interface with seven core actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `RESET` | Initialize or restart the game state |
| `ACTION1` | Simple action - varies by game (e.g., move up, rotate) |
| `ACTION2` | Simple action - varies by game (e.g., move down, flip) |
| `ACTION3` | Simple action - varies by game (e.g., move left, undo) |
| `ACTION4` | Simple action - varies by game (e.g., move right, confirm) |
| `ACTION5` | Simple action - varies by game (e.g., interact, select) |
| `ACTION6` | Complex action requiring x,y coordinates (0-63 range) |

### Human Player Keybindings

When playing games manually in the ARC-AGI-3 UI, you can use these keyboard shortcuts instead of clicking action buttons:

| Control Scheme | ACTION1 | ACTION2 | ACTION3 | ACTION4 | ACTION5 | ACTION6 |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Number Keys** | `1` | `2` | `3` | `4` | `5` | Mouse Click |
| **WASD + Space** | `W` | `S` | `A` | `D` | `Space` | Mouse Click |
| **Arrow Keys + F** | `↑` | `↓` | `←` | `→` | `F` | Mouse Click |

All control schemes support mouse clicking for ACTION6 (coordinate-based actions). Choose whichever scheme feels most comfortable for your playstyle.
