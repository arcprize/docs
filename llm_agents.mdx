The [ARC-AGI-3 Agents repo](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents) provides several pre-built LLM agent templates:

### [LLM Agent](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents/blob/main/agents/templates/llm_agents.py#L16)
- Standard OpenAI API agent that observes the game state and chooses actions using function
  calling, maintains conversation history with 10-message limit.
- Default Model: gpt-4o-mini
- Usage: `--agent=llm`

### [Fast LLM Agent](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents/blob/e61e1238eac285901423afc3921fe4b1a51c6701/agents/templates/llm_agents.py#L472)
- Skips the observation step entirely (DO_OBSERVATION=False), making decisions faster but potentially
  less informed - trades accuracy for speed.
- Default Model: gpt-4o-mini
- Usage: `--agent=fastllm` 

### [ReasoningLLM](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents/blob/e61e1238eac285901423afc3921fe4b1a51c6701/agents/templates/llm_agents.py#L403)
- Uses OpenAI's o4-mini model and captures detailed reasoning metadata including reasoning tokens and thought process in the action.reasoning field.
- Default Model: o4-mini
- Usage: `--agent=reasoningllm` 

### [GuidedLLM](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents/blob/e61e1238eac285901423afc3921fe4b1a51c6701/agents/templates/llm_agents.py#L496)
- Uses the most advanced o3 model with high reasoning effort and includes explicit game-specific rules/strategy in the prompt. This template is for education purposes only, it won't generalize to other games.
- Default Model: o3
- Usage: `--agent=guidedllm` 

### Example Usage

```bash
# Run LLM agent on a specific game
uv run main.py --agent=llm --game=ls20

# Run fast LLM agent on all games
uv run main.py --agent=fastllm
```

## Handling Malformed Outputs

LLM agents are expected to return **exactly one** of the valid action names (`RESET`, `ACTION1` – `ACTION6`).

In the reference implementation we simply call `.strip()` on the model response and forward the resulting string.  In practice a model might return an empty string, additional commentary, or a token that is **not** a valid action.  When that happens the agent will raise a `ValueError` and the current game will terminate.

To make your agent more robust you can:

1. **Post-process the model output** – e.g. extract the first word that looks like an action using a regular expression.
2. **Fallback to a safe action** – if parsing fails, choose a random valid action or repeat the previous one.
3. **Log the bad response in the `reasoning` field** – this makes debugging much easier when you review the replay in the UI.

```python
import re
import random
from agents.structs import GameAction

def safe_parse(model_response: str) -> GameAction:
    """Return a valid action or raise."""
    # take the FIRST all-caps token that matches a known action
    match = re.search(r"(RESET|ACTION[1-6])", model_response)
    if match:
        action_name = match.group(0).strip()
        try:
            return GameAction.from_name(action_name)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    # fallback – here we pick a random non-RESET action
    valid_actions = [a for a in GameAction if a is not GameAction.RESET]
    return random.choice(valid_actions)
```
