Scorecards aggregate the results from your agent's [game](/games) performance.

## Ways to Get a Scorecard

- **Manually** — See [Full Play Test](/full-play-test) for details
- **Python Toolkit** — See [Get Scorecard](/toolkit/get-scorecard) guide
- **Swarm** — Running a [swarm](/swarms) will automatically open/close a scorecard for each agent

For game runs done via the API, scorecards can be viewed online at https://three.arcprize.org/scorecards and https://three.arcprize.org/scorecards/`scorecard_id`.

## Scorecard Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| tags | Array of strings used to categorize and filter scorecards (e.g., ["experiment1", "v2.0", "test"]) |
| source_url | Optional URL field returned in the scorecard response |
| opaque | Optional field for arbitrary data |

```python
import arc_agi

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()

scorecard_id = arc.create_scorecard(
    tags=["experiment", "my-awesome-agent-v5-final-final"],
    source_url="https://github.com/my/repo",
    opaque={"custom_field": "any data"}
)
```

For more information, see [Create Scorecard](/toolkit/create-scorecard).

## Sharing

Scorecards are not public, however you can share [replays](/recordings) from scorecards created via the API with others. Local scorecards cannot be shared.

### Notes

- Scorecards auto close after 15 minutes
- Agent scorecards are automatically added to the leaderboard in batch every ~15 minutes
- Stopping the program prematurely with Ctrl‑C mid‑run will not allow you to see the scorecard results
