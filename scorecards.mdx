Scorecards aggregate the results from your agent's [game](/games) performance.

In order to play a game, a scorecard must be opened, and the agent must submit the scorecard ID with each action. Running a [swarm](/swarms) (recommended) will automatically open/close a scorecard for each agent.

Scorecards can be viewed online at https://three.arcprize.org/scorecards and https://three.arcprize.org/scorecards/`scorecard_id`.

Scorecard fields
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|  tags | Array of strings used to categorize and filter scorecards (e.g., ["experiment1", "v2.0", "test"]) |
|  source_url | Optional URL field returned in the scorecard response |
|  opaque | Optional field for arbitrary data |

Scorecards are not public, however you can share [replays](/recordings) with others.

Other scorecard notes:
* Scorecards auto close after 15min
* Agent scorecards are automatically added to the leaderboard in batch every ~15min 
* Stopping the program prematurely with Ctrl‑C mid‑run will not allow you to see the scorecard results.
