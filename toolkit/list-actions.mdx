---

## Overview

Each ARC-AGI game has its own set of available actions. Before interacting with a game, you can check which actions are supported using the `action_space` property.

## Listing Actions for a Game

Once you've created an environment, use `action_space` to see what actions are available:

```python
import arc_agi

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")

# Get available actions
actions = env.action_space
for action in actions:
    print(action.name)
```

## Understanding Action Information

Each action in the list is a `GameAction` object. You can inspect its properties:

```python
actions = env.action_space

for action in actions:
    print(f"Name: {action.name}")
    print(f"Is complex: {action.is_complex()}")
    print("---")
```

Complex actions (like `ACTION6`) require additional data such as x,y coordinates when called.

## Actions Update Each Step

The available actions can change as you play. After each step, check `action_space` for the current set of valid actions:

```python
from arcengine import GameAction

# Initial actions
print(f"Initial actions: {[a.name for a in env.action_space]}")

# Take an action
obs = env.step(GameAction.ACTION1)

# Actions may have changed
print(f"Current actions: {[a.name for a in env.action_space]}")
```

## Using Actions in Your Agent

Below is a an example of picking a random action from those available:

```python
import random
from arcengine import GameAction

actions = env.action_space

# Choose a random available action
action = random.choice(actions)

# Handle complex actions that need coordinates
action_data = {}
if action.is_complex():
    action_data = {"x": 32, "y": 32}

obs = env.step(action, data=action_data)
```
