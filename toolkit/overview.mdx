ARC-AGI Toolkit is an open-sourced python interface (API) for ARC-AGI-3 interactive environments. It provides a consistent API and tooling layer that lets agents interact with ARC-AGI-3 environments, locally or via API.

## QuickStart

### Prerequisites

1. **Installation** (intended, not yet available):
   ```bash
   uv add arc-agi
   # or
   pip install arc-agi
   ```

2. **API Key**: You can optionally set the `ARC_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key. If no key is provided, an anonymous key will be used. However, registering for an API key will give you access to more games at release. [Register for an API key at https://three.arcprize.org](https://three.arcprize.org)
   
   The code supports loading from `.env` and `.env.example` files (using python-dotenv), or you can set it directly:
   ```bash
   export ARC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   
   Or create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```bash
   echo 'ARC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here' > .env
   ```

## Up Next

Interact with your first environments vai the [Python REPL](./repl) or via a [Python Script](./minimal)
