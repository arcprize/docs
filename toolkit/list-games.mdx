---

## Overview

The ARC-AGI SDK provides access to a variety of interactive puzzle environments. Before playing, you can discover what games are available using the `get_environments()` method.

## Listing All Available Games

Use `get_environments()` to retrieve all games you have access to:

```python
import arc_agi

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()
games = arc.get_environments()

for game in games:
    print(f"{game.game_id}: {game.title}")
```

This returns both local games (from your `environment_files` directory) and remote games available via the API.

## Working with Game Information

Each game in the list is an `EnvironmentInfo` object with useful properties:

```python
games = arc.get_environments()

for game in games:
    print(f"ID: {game.game_id}")
    print(f"Title: {game.title}")
    print(f"Tags: {game.tags}")
    print("---")
```

## Selecting a Game to Play

Once you've found a game you want to play, use its `game_id` with the `make()` method:

```python
# List games and pick one
games = arc.get_environments()
print(f"Found {len(games)} games available")

# Play the first game
if games:
    game_id = games[0].game_id
    env = arc.make(game_id, render_mode="terminal")
```

## Local vs Remote Games

The games returned depend on your operation mode:

| Mode | Games Returned |
|------|----------------|
| `NORMAL` (default) | Local + Remote games |
| `ONLINE` | Remote games only |
| `OFFLINE` | Local games only |

```python
from arc_agi import Arcade, OperationMode

# List both local and remote games (default)
arc = Arcade(operation_mode=OperationMode.NORMAL)
all_games = arc.get_environments()

# List only local games
arc = Arcade(operation_mode=OperationMode.OFFLINE)
local_games = arc.get_environments()

# List only remote games
arc = Arcade(operation_mode=OperationMode.ONLINE)
remote_games = arc.get_environments()
```
