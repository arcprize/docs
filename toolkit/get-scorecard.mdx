---

## Overview

After playing games, you can retrieve your scorecard to see aggregated performance results. The Toolkit automatically manages a default scorecard, or you can create and manage your own.

## Getting the Default Scorecard

The Toolkit automatically creates a scorecard when you start playing. Retrieve it with `get_scorecard()`:

```python
import arc_agi
from arcengine import GameAction

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")

# Play the game
env.step(GameAction.ACTION1)

# Get your scorecard
scorecard = arc.get_scorecard()
if scorecard:
    print(f"Score: {scorecard.score}")
    print(f"Games played: {len(scorecard.games)}")
```

## Scorecard Properties

The scorecard contains your aggregated results:

```python
scorecard = arc.get_scorecard()

if scorecard:
    print(f"Score: {scorecard.score}")
    print(f"Games: {scorecard.games}")
```

## See Full Scorecard

To view the complete scorecard with all fields, use `model_dump_json()`:

```python
scorecard = arc.get_scorecard()

if scorecard:
    print(scorecard.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
