## Overview

When you're done with a scorecard, close it to finalize the results. This is important for proper tracking and leaderboard submission.

## Closing the Default Scorecard

If you're using the default scorecard, simply call `close_scorecard()`:

```python
import arc_agi

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")

# ... play games ...

# Close and get final results
final_scorecard = arc.close_scorecard()

if final_scorecard:
    print(f"Final score: {final_scorecard.score}")
    print(final_scorecard.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

After closing, a new default scorecard will be created on the next `make()` call.

## Closing a Specific Scorecard

If you created a custom scorecard, pass its ID:

```python
# Close a specific scorecard
final_scorecard = arc.close_scorecard(scorecard_id="your-scorecard-id")
```

## Why Close Scorecards?

- Scorecards auto-close after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Closing ensures your results are finalized
- Stopping your program with Ctrl-C without closing may prevent you from seeing results
