Swarms are used to orchestrate your agent across multiple games simultaneously.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents.git
cd ARC-AGI-3-Agents
```

Each `swarm`:

- Creates one agent instance per [game](/games)
- Runs all agents concurrently using threads
- Automatically manages [scorecard](/scorecards) opening and closing
- Handles cleanup when all agents complete
- Provides a link to view [replay](/recordings) online

### Running the Agent Swarm

The agent swarm is executed through `main.py`, which manages agent execution across multiple games with automatic scorecard tracking.

### Swarm Command

```bash
uv run main.py --agent <agent_name> [--game <game_filter>] [--tags <tag_list>]
```

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Short | Required | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `--agent` | `-a` | Yes | Choose which agent to run. Available agents can be found in the `agents/` directory. |
| `--game` | `-g` | No | Filter [games](/games) by ID prefix. Can be comma-separated for multiple filters (e.g., `ls20,ft09`). If not specified, the agent plays all available games. |
| `--tags` | `-t` | No | Comma-separated list of tags for the scorecard (e.g., `experiment,v1.0`). Tags help categorize and track different agent runs. Helpful when you want to compare different agents. Tags will be recorded on your [scorecards](/scorecards). |

### Examples

```bash
# Run the random agent on all games
uv run main.py --agent=random

# Run an LLM agent on only the ls20 game
uv run main.py --agent=llm --game=ls20

# Run with custom tags for tracking
uv run main.py --agent=llm --tags="experiment,gpt-4,baseline"

# Run against an explicit list of games
uv run main.py --agent=random --game="ls20,ft09"
```
