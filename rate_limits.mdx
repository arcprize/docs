The ARC-AGI API is currently free to use during its research preview. To prevent abuse and ensure fair access, we have implemented rate limits with an exponential backoff mechanism.

These limits help maintain system stability by throttling excessive requests. If you encounter rate limiting, your requests will receive a backoff response, requiring you to wait increasingly longer periods before retrying.

Rate limits are set at 600 requests per minute (RPM).

## Requesting Limit Increases

We are open to discussing increases in rate limits, particularly for researchers and teams requiring higher throughput.

If you need elevated limits, please email us at team@arcprize.org with the subject line "Increase Rate Limits" to initiate a conversation.

## Navigating Rate Limits

If you've managed to hit a rate limit, you'll see a standard `429` response.

```json
{"error":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","message":"rate limit has been exceeded"}
```
