  title: ARC‑AGI‑3 REST API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Programmatic interface for running agents against ARC‑AGI‑3 games, opening/closing score‑cards and driving game state with actions.
    All requests **require** an `X‑API‑Key` header issued from the ARC‑AGI‑3 web console.

    **Important: Session Affinity via Cookies**  
    Games are stateful and require session affinity. The server sets cookies (especially `AWSALB*` cookies) in responses that **must be included in all subsequent requests** for the same game session. These cookies route requests to the correct backend instance maintaining your game state. Most HTTP clients handle cookies automatically, but ensure your client preserves and sends cookies received from RESET and ACTION responses.

      description: |
        Starts a new game session **or** resets an existing one, depending on
        whether a `guid` is supplied.

        • **No `guid` (null/empty)** → A brand-new game instance is created and
          the response will include its freshly minted `guid`.

        • **With `guid`** → The server issues a reset to that specific
          instance:
            - If at least one ACTION command has been executed in the **current
              level**, only that level is reset (typical “try again” behaviour).
            - If no ACTION commands have been executed since the last level
              transition, the entire game is reset to its initial state.

        Sending two RESET commands back-to-back therefore always yields a
        completely fresh game.

        All plays should be associated with an open scorecard via `card_id`
        so aggregated results can be tracked.

      description: |
        Creates a new game session **or** resets an existing one,
        depending on the presence of `guid` in the request body:

        • **Omit `guid` or set it to `null`** → start a brand-new game
          instance.  
        • **Provide an existing `guid`** → reset that session.  
          - If at least one ACTION command has been issued since the last
            level transition, only the **current level** is restarted.  
          - If no ACTIONs have been issued, the entire game resets.  
          Two consecutive RESETs therefore guarantee a completely fresh
          game.

        The call always returns the first (or refreshed) frame of the
        game state, along with updated score and win condition.

        **Note:** The response includes cookies (particularly `AWSALB*` cookies) that must be included in all subsequent ACTION commands for this session. These cookies ensure requests are routed to the same backend instance maintaining your game state.

        include “click/tap at (x,y)”, “place a tile”, or “shoot a
        projectile,” depending on the game's mechanics.

        Required fields  
        • `game_id` — the game to act in  
        • `guid`    — session identifier obtained from RESET  
        • `x`,`y`   — zero-based grid coordinates (0-63 inclusive)

        On success the server applies the action, advances game logic to
        the next stable frame, and returns that frame together with the
        updated score, state, and win condition.

      summary: Execute simple action 7
      description: |
        Issues **ACTION 7** to the specified game session.  
        This is a single-parameter command (no X/Y coordinates): 
        ACTION7 will always be an undo action for games that support it.

        The request must include:
        • `game_id` — which game to act on  
        • `guid` — the active session identifier returned from RESET  

        An optional `reasoning` JSON blob (≤ 16 KB) can be attached for
        audit or research purposes.

        A successful call returns the next visual frame(s) and updated
        score/state.
