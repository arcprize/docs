      type: object
      description: |
        Starts a new game session **or** resets an existing one, depending on
        whether a `guid` is supplied.

        • **No `guid` (null/empty)** → A brand-new game instance is created and
          the response will include its freshly minted `guid`.

        • **With `guid`** → The server issues a reset to that specific
          instance:
            - If at least one ACTION command has been executed in the **current
              level**, only that level is reset (typical “try again” behaviour).
            - If no ACTION commands have been executed since the last level
              transition, the entire game is reset to its initial state.

        Sending two RESET commands back-to-back therefore always yields a
        completely fresh game.

        All plays should be associated with an open scorecard via `card_id`
        so aggregated results can be tracked.

      summary: Start or reset a game instance and receive the first frame
      description: |
        Creates a new game session **or** resets an existing one,
        depending on the presence of `guid` in the request body:

        • **Omit `guid` or set it to `null`** → start a brand-new game
          instance.  
        • **Provide an existing `guid`** → reset that session.  
          - If at least one ACTION command has been issued since the last
            level transition, only the **current level** is restarted.  
          - If no ACTIONs have been issued, the entire game resets.  
          Two consecutive RESETs therefore guarantee a completely fresh
          game.

        The call always returns the first (or refreshed) frame of the
        game state, along with updated score and win condition.

      description: |
        Issues **ACTION 5** to the specified game session.  
        This is a single-parameter command (no X/Y coordinates): the exact
        in-game effect depends on the title—for example, it might
        represent “jump”, "rotate", "fire" or “select option E”.

        The request must include:
        • `game_id` — which game to act on  
        • `guid` — the active session identifier returned from RESET  

        An optional `reasoning` JSON blob (≤ 16 KB) can be attached for
        audit or research purposes.

        A successful call returns the next visual frame(s) and updated
        score/state.

      summary: Execute complex action (requires x,y)
      description: |
        Issues **ACTION 6**—a two-parameter command that supplies explicit
        X/Y coordinates—to an active game session.  Common use-cases
        include “click/tap at (x,y)”, “place a tile”, or “shoot a
        projectile,” depending on the game's mechanics.

        Required fields  
        • `game_id` — the game to act in  
        • `guid`    — session identifier obtained from RESET  
        • `x`,`y`   — zero-based grid coordinates (0-63 inclusive)

        On success the server applies the action, advances game logic to
        the next stable frame, and returns that frame together with the
        updated score, state, and win condition.
