Get up and running with arc-agi in just 4 lines:

```python
from arc_agi import ArcAgi
from arcengine import GameAction
arc = ArcAgi()
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")
```

See the actions you can take, take one, and check your scorecard:

```python
print(env.action_space)
obs = env.step(GameAction.ACTION1)
print(arc.get_scorecard())
```
