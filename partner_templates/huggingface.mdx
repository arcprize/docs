These templates provide a great starting point for building agents with the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem. Check out the [smolagents documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index) to learn more.

- **`SmolCodingAgent`**: A text-based agent that uses a code-generating model to reason about the game and execute actions as Python code.
- **`SmolVisionAgent`**: A multimodal agent that processes game frames as images, allowing it to "see" the game state.

To run these agents, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the text-based coding agent
uv run main.py --agent=smolcodingagent --game=ls20
`
# Run the vision-based agent
uv run main.py --agent=smolvisionagent --game=ls20
```
