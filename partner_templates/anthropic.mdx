[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) is Anthropic’s code interface for the Claude family of models. A member of the Claude Code team has published an SDK that wires Claude Code into the ARC-AGI-3 API so you can drive games directly from the terminal.

Repository: https://github.com/ThariqS/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK

Key features:

- Minimal JavaScript/Node CLI wrappers (no Python required).
- Helper scripts for listing games, opening / closing score-cards, and submitting actions.
- Turn-based “auto-solver” (`play-arc-with-claude.js`) that lets Claude iteratively reason about the grid, decide on the next action, and track progress.
- Works with the **Claude Code CLI** (install via `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude`) so you can hop into an interactive session at any point.

Quick start:

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ThariqS/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK.git
cd ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK && npm install

# Initialise with your API key
node init.js --api-key YOUR_ARC_API_KEY

# Let Claude solve the default game for up to 50 turns
node play-arc-with-claude.js

# …or target a specific game (example: ls20)
node play-arc-with-claude.js ls20-016295f7601e 100
```

The SDK ships with convenience scripts in the `actions/` folder (`list-games.js`, `start-game.js`, `action.js`, etc.) if you prefer a more manual driving style.

Because this template lives in its own repository, you don’t invoke it via `uv run main.py`; instead run the Node scripts shown above (or adapt them to your workflow).
