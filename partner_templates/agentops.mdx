[AgentOps](https://agentops.ai) provides observability and debugging tools for AI agents. These templates are designed to help you get the most out of their platform.

### ReasoningAgent

This template provides a reasoning agent that maintains a history of its actions and observations to build a hypothesis about the game's rules. It's fully integrated with AgentOps for detailed tracing and debugging, giving you more information about your agent's performance.

To run this agent:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent=reasoningagent --game=ls20
```

### AgentOps Tracing

When you install the `agentops` package and set your API key, all agents are automatically decorated with `@trace_agent_session`. This streams detailed traces of your agent's execution to your AgentOps dashboard.

To enable tracing:

```bash
uv sync --extra agentops
```

And add your API key to your `.env` file:

```bash
AGENTOPS_API_KEY="your_agentops_api_key"
```
