Create AI agents that can play ARC-AGI-3 games by implementing the required interface methods. The following is based off the [ARC-AGI-3 Agents repo](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents).

## Adding and Running Your Own Agent

Follow these three steps to create and run a new agent.

### Step 1: Create Your Agent File

First, head over to the [ARC-AGI-3-Agents](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents) repo and clone it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents.git
```

Make sure you have your ARC-AGI-API-KEY populated in your environment variables. You can obtain this key by signing up for an account on the [ARC-AGI-3 website](https://three.arcprize.org).

Next, create a new Python file for your agent inside the `agents/` directory. For this example, let's copy the `random_agent.py` template.

```bash
cp agents/templates/random_agent.py agents/my_awesome_agent.py
```

Now, modify `agents/my_awesome_agent.py` and rename the class to `MyAwesomeAgent`.

```python
# agents/my_awesome_agent.py

from .agent import Agent # Make sure to change from `..` imports
from .structs import FrameData, GameAction, GameState # Make sure to change from `..` imports
import random

# Rename the class
class MyAwesomeAgent(Agent):
    """A simple agent that chooses random actions."""
    
    def is_done(self, frames: list[FrameData], latest_frame: FrameData) -> bool:
        # Your logic to determine if the game is finished
        return latest_frame.state is GameState.WIN

    def choose_action(self, frames: list[FrameData], latest_frame: FrameData) -> GameAction:
        # Your custom decision-making logic goes here
        if latest_frame.state in [GameState.NOT_PLAYED, GameState.GAME_OVER]:
            # Start or restart the game
            action = GameAction.RESET
        else:
            # Choose a random action (except RESET)
            action = random.choice([a for a in GameAction if a is not GameAction.RESET])
        
        # Add reasoning for simple actions
        if action.is_simple():
            action.reasoning = f"Chose {action.value} randomly"
        # For complex actions, set coordinates
        elif action.is_complex():
            action.set_data({
                "x": random.randint(0, 63),
                "y": random.randint(0, 63),
            })
            action.reasoning = {"action": action.value, "reason": "Random choice"}
        
        return action
```

### Step 2: Ensure Your Agent is Automatically Registered

To make your agent available to run, add an import statement to `agents/__init__.py` and add it to the `AVAILABLE_AGENTS` dictionary:

```python
# agents/__init__.py
# ... existing imports ...
from .my_awesome_agent import MyAwesomeAgent

__all__ = [
    # ... existing agents ...
    "MyAwesomeAgent",
    "AVAILABLE_AGENTS",
]
``` 

### Step 3: Run Your Agent

Your agent is now registered and ready to run. Use the class name in lower case as the value for the `--agent` argument.

```bash
# Run your custom agent on the 'ls20' game
uv run main.py --agent=myawesomeagent --game=ls20
```

You can also run it against all available games:

```bash
# Run your agent on all games
uv run main.py --agent=myawesomeagent
```

That's it! The `main.py` script handles looking up your agent in the registry, instantiating it, and running it against the specified games.

The [replay](/recordings) of your agent is available at the end of the run. Make sure to watch your agent at play.

## Troubleshooting

### Relative Import Errors

If you move an agent file or create a new one outside the `agents/` directory, you may encounter `ImportError` exceptions related to relative imports.

**Solution:**
Ensure your import statements use the correct relative pathing. The `..` prefix goes up one directory level.

For example, if your agent is in `agents/my_agents/my_file.py`, the imports should look like this:

```python
# agents/my_agents/my_file.py

# Correct: Go up one level to the 'agents' package root
from ..agent import Agent
from ..structs import FrameData

# Incorrect: Assumes the file is in the 'agents' root
# from .agent import Agent 
```

### Agent Not Found Errors

If you see `ValueError: Agent '<your-agent>' not found`, double-check the following:
1.  Your agent class is correctly located in the `agents` directory (or a subdirectory).
2.  The class name is correctly spelled and matches the name you provided to the `--agent` flag (in lower case).
3.  You have saved your changes to your agent file.
