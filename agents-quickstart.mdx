Get started with the [ARC-AGI-3 Agents repo](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents).

Watch the [Agent Quickstart tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEVg9dcJMkw).

## Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents.git
cd ARC-AGI-3-Agents
```

Make sure you have your `ARC_API_KEY` populated in your environment variables. See [API Keys](/api-keys) for setup instructions.

## Step 2: Run an Agent

Run the random agent on the `ls20` game:

```bash
uv run main.py --agent=random --game=ls20
```

The [replay](/recordings) of your agent is available at the end of the run.
