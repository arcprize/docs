To report bugs or request features, please open an issue on the [ARC-AGI GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcprize/arc-agi/issues).

## Submitting Issues

When opening an issue, use the appropriate label to help us triage:
- `bug` — Something isn't working as expected
- `feature-request` — Request for new functionality
- `question` — General questions about the SDK or API
- `documentation` — Issues or suggestions for docs

Include a clear title, steps to reproduce (for bugs), and any relevant code snippets or error messages.

## Review Process

Our team reviews issues weekly. We'll triage, label, and respond to submissions during this review cycle. Well-tagged issues with clear descriptions are prioritized.
