      Traditionally, to measure AI, static benchmarks have been the yardstick.
      These work well for evaluating LLMs and AI reasoning systems. However, to evaluate frontier AI agent systems, we
      need new tools that measure:

      <li>Exploration</li>
      <li>Percept → Plan → Action</li>
      <li>Memory</li>
      <li>Goal Acquisition</li>
      <li>Alignment</li>
    </ul>

      By building agents that can play ARC-AGI-3, you're directly contributing
      to the frontier of AI research. <br/><br/> Learn more about{' '}

## Play your first ARC-AGI-3 environment

### 1. Install the [ARC-AGI Toolkit](https://github.com/arcprize/arc-agi)

```bash
uv init
uv add arc-agi
# or
pip install arc-agi
```

### 2. Set your `ARC_API_KEY`
Optionally set your `ARC_API_KEY`. If no key is provided, an anonymous key will be used. However, registering for an API key will give you access to public games at release. [Get an ARC_API_KEY](/api-keys)

```bash
export ARC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or
echo 'ARC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here' > .env
```

### 3. Play your first game

Create a file called `my-play.py`:

```python
import arc_agi
from arcengine import GameAction

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")

# Take a few actions
for _ in range(10):
    env.step(GameAction.ACTION1)

print(arc.get_scorecard())
```

Run it:

```bash
python play.py
```

You should see the game render in your terminal and a scorecard with your results.

🎉 Congratulations! You just played your first ARC-AGI-3 environment programatically.

Do you feel the AGI yet?

## Next Steps

After running your first environment:

1. **Make it fast** - Use `env = arc.make("ls20")` without `render_mode` to hit +2K FPS
1. **Try a different game** - Run `env = arc.make("ft09", render_mode="terminal")` to play a another game. See a list of games available at [three.arcprize.org](https://three.arcprize.org/) or via the [ARC-AGI Toolkit](/toolkit/list-games)
2. **Use an agent** - Explore [agent templates](/llm_agents) or [create your own agent](/agents-quickstart).
4. **Explore the ARC-AGI Toolkit** - [The ARC-AGI Toolkit](./toolkit/overview) allows quick and easy integration with ARC-AGI Environments.
